=======================================================================

## Vue.js

### Research Conducted By:
* Ben Harris
* Timothy Li

### Overall Score and Comments
#### Score (Out of 10): 9/10
#### General Comments
* Vue.js is an open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications. (MIT License)

* Founded by Evan You in February, 2014. Latest release as of writing: 2.5.17.

* 30.67 KB in production. 279 KB in development.

* Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable (i.e. in small chunks).

* The core library is focused on the view layer, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.

* Vue advertises itself to be (1) approachable, (2) versatile, and (3) performant. It is also open source and released under the MIT license.

#### Pros
* Open source
* Separation of concerns (HTML/CSS/JS)
* Very similar to React
* CLI 
* Fast
* CodeSandbox support

#### Cons
* Framework specific syntax to learn
* Flexibility may result in different project structures

### Ratings and Reviews
#### Documentation
* Installation of Vue was a breeze. Simply install the latest version of the Vue CLI, and run `vue init webpack my-project` to create a new Vue app on your local machine. Alternatively, you can also create a sandbox in CodeSandbox.io.

* All in all this is a very solid framework to consider using that has shown a lot of growth over the last few years (with no signs of slowing).

#### Systems Requirements
* Vue.js is a JavaScript frontend framework, and can run on top of any JS supporting backend server (Node, Rails, etc.).

* Vue.js includes an optional (but recommended) CLI that can be installed via **NPM** or **Yarn**.

* Vue.js is compatible with all client and mobile browsers.

#### Ramp-Up Projections
* Based on our analysis, we feel it would take a team of mid-junior developers around 1-2 weeks to become productive with this framework. The first week would be spent getting familiar with the syntax and comfortable, while the second week would be more focused around identifying creative solutions and best practices. It's fairly straightforward.

#### Community Support and Adoption levels
* The documentation is VERY robust and well-written. (Powered by Algolia)

* Vue.js is supported by an active developer community.

* The Vue.js framework was introduced in 2014, and is considered one of the top 3 JavaScript frameworks as of December 2018 (next to React and Angular). It has been integrated into a number of popular websites (including Facebook and Netflix), and is very popular among many of the Asian unicorns as well (Xioami, Alibaba).
