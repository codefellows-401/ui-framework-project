=======================================================================

## Vue.js

### Research Conducted By:
* Ben Harris
* Timothy Li

### Overall Score and Comments
#### Score (Out of 10): 9/10
#### General Comments
Vue.js is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. 

The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.

Vue advertises itself to be (1) approachable, (2) versatile, and (3) performant. It is also open source and released under the MIT license.

#### Pros
* Open source
* Separation of concerns (HTML/CSS/JS)
* Very similar to React
* CLI 
* Fast
* CodeSandbox support

#### Cons
* Framework specific syntax to learn

### Ratings and Reviews
#### Documentation
Installation of Vue was a breeze. Simply install the latest version of the Vue CLI, and run `vue init webpack my-project` to create a new Vue app on your local machine. Alternatively, you can also create a sandbox in CodeSandbox.io.

All in all this is a very solid framework to consider using that has shown a lot of growth over the last few years (with no signs of slowing).

#### Systems Requirements
Vue.js is simply a JavaScript framework, and as-such is compatible with just about every platform that supports JavaScript and Node. Some basic requirements include:

* **Node:** Required to install Vue CLI

In terms of hosting, you are free to use your favorite platform of choice, be it AWS, Azure, Heroku, DigitalOcean, etc.

Additionally, Vue.js works with any databases that are supported by Node.js. Simply install the necessary dependencies to connect your Node module, and you're good to go. Vue's syntax will allow you to retrieve any information that Node can access.

#### Ramp-Up Projections
Based on our analysis, we feel it would take a team of mid-junior developers around 1-2 weeks to become productive with this framework. The first week would be spent getting familiar with the syntax and comfortable, while the second week would be more focused around identifying creative solutions and best practices. It's fairly straightforward.

#### Community Support and Adoption levels
The Vue.js framework was introduced in 2014, and is considered one of the top 3 JavaScript frameworks as of December 2018 (next to React and Angular). It has been integrated into a number of popular websites (including Facebook and Netflix), and is very popular among many of the Asian unicorns as well (Xioami, Alibaba). 

In general, the documentation is VERY robust and well-written. Furthermore, Vue.js is supported by an active and helpful community.
